# How to Build MVP

## Background

Most first-time builders fail because they build too much before testing. The goal is to learn, not to launch a polished product.

```
Pain point → Hypothesis → Build minimal → Test → Learn → Iterate
```

---

## Do this

### Steps

1. **Identify pain point** — What problem? Would they pay?
2. **Define hypothesis** — "If I build [X], then [audience] will [Y]"
3. **Build minimum** — One feature, basic UI
4. **Test with real users** — Not friends, real target users
5. **Measure** — Did they use it? Come back? Tell someone?
6. **Iterate or pivot**

### Timeline

| Week | Goal |
|------|------|
| 1 | Core feature works |
| 2 | Basic UI + internal testing |
| 3 | Ship to real users |

## Mistakes we made

| Mistake | Why it fails | What to do instead |
|---------|--------------|-------------------|
| Too many features | Dilutes focus, delays launch | One feature, ship it |
| Waiting for perfect | Perfect = never | Ship when it works |
| Ignoring feedback | Building blind | Listen to testers, not your ego |
| "Looks great" = validated | Interest is not usage | Track retention, not compliments |

*Ship first. Polish later.*
