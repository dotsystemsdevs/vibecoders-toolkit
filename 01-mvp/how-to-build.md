# How to Build MVP

```
Pain point → Hypothesis → Build minimal → Test → Learn → Iterate
```

---

## Steps

1. **Identify pain point** — What problem? Would they pay?
2. **Define hypothesis** — "If I build [X], then [audience] will pay [Y]"
3. **Build minimum** — One feature, basic UI
4. **Test with real users** — Not friends, real target users
5. **Measure** — Did they use it? Pay? Come back?
6. **Iterate or pivot**

## Timeline

| Week | Goal |
|------|------|
| 1 | Core feature works |
| 2 | Basic UI + internal testing |
| 3 | Ship to real users |

---

## Mistakes to avoid

| Mistake | Why it fails |
|---------|--------------|
| Too many features | Dilutes focus, delays launch |
| Not launching early | Waiting for perfect = never |
| Ignoring feedback | Building blind |
| "Looks great" = validated | Interest ≠ payment |

*Ship first. Polish later.*
