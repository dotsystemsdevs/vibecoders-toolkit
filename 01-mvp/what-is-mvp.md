# What is MVP?

> "The version of a new product which allows a team to collect the maximum amount of validated learning about customers with the least effort." — Eric Ries

**Key:** Until someone gives you money, you haven't validated.

## When is it done?

- [ ] One core feature works end-to-end
- [ ] You can demo it in 60 seconds
- [ ] A stranger can use it without help
- [ ] You're slightly embarrassed

> "If you're not embarrassed by the first version of your product, you've launched too late." — Reid Hoffman
