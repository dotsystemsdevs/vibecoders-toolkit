# What is MVP?

## Background

> "The version of a new product which allows a team to collect the maximum amount of validated learning about customers with the least effort." — Eric Ries

Until someone uses your app and comes back, you haven't validated anything.

## Do this

### Checklist — is your MVP done?

- [ ] One core feature works end-to-end
- [ ] You can demo it in 60 seconds
- [ ] A stranger can use it without help
- [ ] You're slightly embarrassed by it

> "If you're not embarrassed by the first version of your product, you've launched too late." — Reid Hoffman
