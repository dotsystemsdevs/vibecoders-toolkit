---

## Before closed testing

### Checklist

- [ ] App works (doesn't need to be perfect)
- [ ] Play Store images ready (Figma)
- [ ] AAB built and uploaded
- [ ] Closed testing group created in Play Console

### Tools

| Tool | Use |
|------|-----|
| Figma | Screenshots + basic branding for Play Store |
| GitHub | Version control + backlog + branches + CI/CD |
| Play Console | Closed testing |

**Action:** Don't wait for perfection. Ship when it works.

---

## Why closed testing first?

| Reason | Action |
|--------|--------|
| Get feedback before going live | Ship to closed test, not production |
| Find bugs early | Let real users break it |
| Validate the need exists | Post in niche forums to confirm demand |

---

## Targets

| Metric | Target | Why |
|--------|--------|-----|
| Members | 30+ | Enough data for decisions |
| Timeline | ~2 weeks | Before next major update |

---

## Naming

Neutral names reach broader audiences.

| Before | After | Result |
|--------|-------|--------|
| "lotty-tracker" | "win/loss tracker" | Broader appeal |
| "Lost Ball Counter" | "Mulligan: The Real Scorecard" | More professional |

**Action:** Remove niche jargon from app name. Keep it generic.

## Recruit testers

### What worked

| Channel | Result | Action |
|---------|--------|--------|
| r/AndroidClosedTesting | Best results | Post here first |
| Niche forums (e.g. golf forums) | Great feedback + validates need | Post to get quality feedback |
| Reddit test-for-test | Works with right strategy | Reply fast, be active |

### What did NOT work

| Channel | Result | Action |
|---------|--------|--------|
| Discord | 1 person | Skip it |
| Telegram | No response | Skip it |
| Reddit UX/UI groups | Ban + negative response | Never post here for testers |

### Strategy

| Step | Action |
|------|--------|
| 1 | Post in r/AndroidClosedTesting |
| 2 | Turn on notifications |
| 3 | Reply fast to "test for test" comments |
| 4 | Schedule Reddit time (avoid 24/7) |
| 5 | Be active when USA is awake |
| 6 | Send ~15 messages per day |

### Key insights

| Observation | Action |
|-------------|--------|
| Less effort after day 3-4 still gave results | Don't burn out early, pace yourself |
| Testers go inactive after 14 days | Plan for churn, keep recruiting |
| Test-for-test requires reciprocation | Budget time to test others' apps |
| Niche forums = goldmine | Always post in forums where your users are |
