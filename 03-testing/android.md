# Closed Testing

## Background

Google Play requires closed testing before production. You need real testers using your app for 14 days. This is where you find bugs, validate demand, and learn what users actually do.

---

## Do this

### Before you start

- [ ] App works (doesn't need to be perfect)
- [ ] Play Store screenshots ready (Figma)
- [ ] AAB built and uploaded
- [ ] Closed testing group created in Play Console

### Targets

| Metric | Target | Why |
|--------|--------|-----|
| Members | 30+ | Enough data for decisions |
| Timeline | ~2 weeks | Before next major update |

### Naming matters

Neutral names reach broader audiences.

| Before | After | Result |
|--------|-------|--------|
| "lotty-tracker" | "win/loss tracker" | Broader appeal |
| "Lost Ball Counter" | "Mulligan: The Real Scorecard" | More professional |

### Recruit testers

**What works:**

| Channel | Result |
|---------|--------|
| r/AndroidClosedTesting | Best results, start here |
| Niche forums (golf, finance, etc.) | Great feedback + validates demand |
| Reddit test-for-test | Works if you reply fast |

**What does NOT work:**

| Channel | Result |
|---------|--------|
| Discord | 1 person |
| Telegram | No response |
| Reddit UX/UI groups | Ban + negative response |

### Strategy

1. Post in r/AndroidClosedTesting
2. Turn on notifications
3. Reply fast to "test for test" comments
4. Be active when USA is awake
5. Send ~15 messages per day
6. Schedule Reddit time — avoid 24/7

## Evidence

### Lotty — 110 testers in 12 days

| Day | Members | Active users |
|-----|---------|--------------|
| 1 | 25 | 1 |
| 2 | 40 | 24 |
| 3 | 57 | 41 |
| 4 | 73 | 53 |
| 5 | 86 | 70 |
| 7 | 96 | 71 |
| 12 | 110 | ~12 |

### Mulligan — 130 testers in 6 days

| Day | Members |
|-----|---------|
| 1 | 28 |
| 2 | 44 |
| 3 | 67 |
| 6 | 130 |

Mulligan grew faster because we posted in golf forums — niche communities validate demand AND give better feedback.

### Key patterns

| Observation | What we do now |
|-------------|---------------|
| Less effort after day 3-4 still gave results | Pace yourself, don't burn out early |
| Testers go inactive after 14 days | Plan for churn, keep recruiting |
| Test-for-test requires reciprocation | Budget time to test others' apps |
| Niche forums = goldmine | Always post where your users are |
| 100+ members is enough for approval | Don't over-recruit |
