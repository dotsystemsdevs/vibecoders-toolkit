# Prompts

A small set of prompts I use to keep my process consistent (repo setup, journaling, backlog, changelog).

## Rules
- Do not invent numbers, events, or claims.
- If I paste messy notes: rewrite them into clean, technical, concise text without changing meaning.
- If anything is unclear: ask questions before writing final content.

## Index
- Repo setup: `repo-setup.md`
- Rewrite notes: `rewrite-notes.md`
- Backlog: `backlog.md`
- Changelog: `changelog.md`
- Weekly summary: `weekly-summary.md`
