I will paste my current shipping-playbook content (journal + lessons + metrics).

TASK
1) Write a concise technical summary of "how things look right now":
   - What shipped recently
   - What channels worked / didn't
   - Current risks
   - Current priorities for the next patch

2) Propose minimal changes you would make to my system (structure/process):
   - At most 5 changes
   - Each change must include: what to change + why + where (file/path)

3) Do NOT invent any numbers or events. Use only what I pasted.

4) If something important is missing, ask up to 3 very specific questions at the end.

OUTPUT FORMAT
- Summary (bullets, max ~10 lines)
- Suggested changes (table: Change / Why / Where)
- Questions (if needed)
```
