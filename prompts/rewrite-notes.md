I will paste messy Swedish notes. Your job is to rewrite them into clean, technical, concise Swedish.

RULES
- Do not invent anything.
- Keep meaning the same, but remove fluff.
- If something is ambiguous, ask before finalizing.

TARGET FILES
- journal/ (chronological logs)
- ROADMAP.md (learnings go here)

OUTPUT
1) Propose exact filenames.
2) Return full file contents, ready to paste into repo.
```
