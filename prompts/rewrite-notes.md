I will paste messy Swedish notes. Your job is to rewrite them into clean, technical, concise Swedish and split them into the correct files.

RULES
- Do not invent anything.
- Keep meaning the same, but remove fluff.
- If something is ambiguous, ask a clarifying question before finalizing.

TARGET FILES
- journal/ (chronological logs)
- lessons/success-factors.md (what worked)
- lessons/frictions.md (what didn't work)
- metrics/*.csv (numbers only)
- lessons/*.md for topic docs (e.g., closed testing strategy)

OUTPUT
1) Propose exact filenames.
2) Return full file contents for each target file, ready to paste into the repo.
```
