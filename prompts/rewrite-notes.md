```text
I will paste messy notes. Your job is to rewrite them into clean, technical, concise English.

RULES
- Do not invent anything.
- Keep meaning the same, but remove fluff.
- Every observation must have an action.
- If something is ambiguous, ask before finalizing.

TARGET FILE
- GUIDE.md (all learnings go here)

FORMAT
Use tables with columns: Observation | Action
Or: Mistake | What happened | Action

OUTPUT
1) Propose where in GUIDE.md the content belongs.
2) Return the content, ready to paste into repo.
