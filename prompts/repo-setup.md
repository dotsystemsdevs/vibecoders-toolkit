You are my assistant inside Cursor. Create a NEW GitHub repo structure for a personal "shipping playbook" where I document my app shipping process and lessons learned.

IMPORTANT
- I'm junior. Keep it simple and lightweight.
- This is ongoing (not limited to a fixed number of weeks).
- STRUCTURE ONLY: do not write any real content yet.
- After creating the structure, ask me to paste my notes.

TASK
1) Create folders:
   - templates/
   - journal/
   - lessons/
   - metrics/
   - screenshots/ (optional evidence storage)
   - prompts/
2) Create placeholder files (no made-up content):
   - README.md
   - ROADMAP.md
   - templates/BACKLOG.md
   - templates/CHANGELOG.md
   - journal/_INDEX.md
   - lessons/success-factors.md
   - lessons/frictions.md
   - metrics/metrics.csv
3) Add naming rules:
   - Journal entries: YYYY-MM-DD-short-title.md
   - Screenshots (if used): YYYY-MM-DD-area-desc.png

OUTPUT
- Print the folder tree.
- Print the full contents of each created file (placeholders only).
- Then STOP and ask me to paste my notes.
```
