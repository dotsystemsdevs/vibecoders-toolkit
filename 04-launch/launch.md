# Launch

## Background

Launch is moving from closed testing to production on Google Play. It's not the finish line — it's where the real work starts.

## Do this

### Before launch

- [ ] 100+ testers in closed testing
- [ ] Major bugs fixed
- [ ] Store listing ready

### Store listing

**Description:**
```

Both Mulligan and Lotty went from closed testing to production. Lotty with 110 testers, Mulligan with 136. Both approved without issues. The key was having enough testers and fixing the obvious bugs before submitting.
