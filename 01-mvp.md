# 01 MVP

The smallest product someone will pay for.

---

## What is MVP?

> "The version of a new product which allows a team to collect the maximum amount of validated learning about customers with the least effort." — Eric Ries

**Key:** Until someone gives you money, you haven't validated.

## Timeline

| Week | Goal |
|------|------|
| 1 | Core feature works |
| 2 | Basic UI + internal testing |
| 3 | Ship to real users |

---

## When is it done?

- [ ] One core feature works end-to-end
- [ ] You can demo it in 60 seconds
- [ ] A stranger can use it without help
- [ ] You're slightly embarrassed

> "If you're not embarrassed by the first version of your product, you've launched too late." — Reid Hoffman

## Steps

```
Pain point → Hypothesis → Build minimal → Test → Learn → Iterate
```

1. **Identify pain point** — What problem? Would they pay?
2. **Define hypothesis** — "If I build [X], then [audience] will pay [Y]"
3. **Build minimum** — One feature, basic UI
4. **Test with real users** — Not friends, real target users
5. **Measure** — Did they use it? Pay? Come back?
6. **Iterate or pivot**

## Mistakes to avoid

| Mistake | Why it fails |
|---------|--------------|
| Too many features | Dilutes focus, delays launch |
| Not launching early | Waiting for perfect = never |
| Ignoring feedback | Building blind |
| "Looks great" = validated | Interest ≠ payment |

## Examples

| Company | MVP | Tested |
|---------|-----|--------|
| Uber | SMS to call taxi | Would people order rides via phone? |
| Dropbox | Explainer video | Is there demand? |
| Amazon | Online bookstore | Will people buy books online? |

*Ship first. Polish later.*
