## Instagram Branding Rules

### ig2vec: How Instagram Groups You

Instagram uses **account embeddings** (ig2vec) to figure out what type of account you are. It looks at:
- What accounts you interact with
- What accounts interact with you
- What content you post

**Action:** Stay in ONE topic so Instagram can properly categorize and recommend your account.

### One Topic Per Account

> "Pick one clear niche. Instagram can't recommend you if it doesn't know what you are."

| BAD | GOOD |
|-----|------|
| Posts about golf, cooking, and cats | Only posts about golf |
| Random mix of topics | Consistent theme |
| Algorithm confused | Algorithm knows who to show you to |

### Bio Formula

Your bio has 3 parts:

| Part | Purpose | Example |
|------|---------|---------|
| **Clear Bio** | What you do / who you are | "bad at golf, good at excuses" |
| **Category** | Type of content (set in settings) | App, Gaming, Personal Blog |
| **Call-to-Action** | Where to go / what to do | "Track your rounds 👇" |

### Nameplate = Most Searchable

Your **Name field** (not username) is searchable. Include keywords people actually search for.

| Account | Name Field Should Be |
|---------|---------------------|
| Slothy | "Slothy · Todo List App" |
| Mulligan | "Mulligan · Golf Scorecard" |
| Dev | "Dot · Indie App Dev" |

### Set Your Category

Go to: **Settings → Edit Profile → Category**

| Account | Category to Set |
|---------|-----------------|
| Slothy | App |
| Mulligan | App |
| Dev | App / Personal Blog |

___________________________________________________________

## SLOTHY (@slothy_app)

**Current:** 9 followers, 4 posts

**Target:** Anyone who struggles with productivity

**Vibe:** Lazy sloth energy, no guilt, relatable procrastination humor

### Bio

**Name field:** `Slothy · Todo List App`

**Bio:**
```
What you don't do today moves to tomorrow.
No guilt. Offline. No login.
Download 👇
```

**Category:** App

| Part | ✅ |
|------|---|
| Clear Bio | "What you don't do today moves to tomorrow" |
| Category | App (set in settings) |
| Call-to-Action | "Download 👇" + link |

✅ Bio follows the formula. Tagline is perfect.

### Performance Data
| Post | Type | Views |
|------|------|-------|
| "Task graveyard sponsored by 4 unused to-do apps" | Reel | 238 |
| "Everything I said I'd do today.. moved to tomorrow" | Reel | 284 |
| Logo post | Image | — |
| "Simple daily task planning" (app screenshot) | Image | Lower |

**Key insight:** Reels with meme format = 200-300 views on 9 followers. That's solid reach. App screenshots = less engagement.

### What's Working
- ✅ Meme reels get reach (238-284 views)
- ✅ Relatable humor ("task graveyard", "moved to tomorrow")
- ✅ Logo is memorable
- ✅ Bio matches the content vibe

### What to Adjust
- ⚠️ Less app screenshots, more meme reels
- ⚠️ The reel format is clearly winning — lean into it
- ⚠️ Keep promotional content minimal (1x/week max)

### Visual Style
- **Colors:** Dark background, warm tones in memes
- **Logo:** Simple black sloth with white eyes — cute and recognizable
- **Content:** Meme templates with text overlay (Jimmy Fallon style works)

### Content Voice
- Lazy, unbothered, everything is exhausting
- No guilt energy
- Self-aware procrastinator

**Examples:**
- "Checked off one task. Nap time."
- "The list can wait. The couch cannot."
- "Productivity? In this economy?"

### Strategy for Week 1
**Focus on reels** — they're getting 25-30x your follower count in views. That's the algorithm working for you.

| Priority | Content Type |
|----------|--------------|
| 1st | Meme reels (like task graveyard) |
| 2nd | Relatable text posts |
| 3rd | App screenshots (max 1x/week) |

## MULLIGAN (@app_mulligan)

**Current:** 4 followers, 10 posts

**Target:** Casual golfers who lose balls

**Vibe:** Sarcastic golf roasts, self-deprecating humor

### Bio

**Name field:** `Mulligan · Golf Scorecard`

**Bio:**
```
bad at golf, good at excuses
tracking my rounds so i can prove it wasn't my fault
Download the app 👇
```

**Category:** App

| Part | ✅ |
|------|---|
| Clear Bio | "bad at golf, good at excuses" |
| Category | App (set in settings) |
| Call-to-Action | "Download the app 👇" + link |

✅ Matches the sarcastic Mulligan Advice voice.

### Performance Data
| Post | Type | Views |
|------|------|-------|
| Golf ball close-up (pure visual) | Reel | **190** |
| "Missing 36 golfballs" | Reel | 44 |
| "Golfing really bad" Vince McMahon meme | Reel | 40 |
| "Woods hits six trees" | Reel | 37 |
| Logo | Image | 36 |
| "Send to someone who can't outdrive you" | Reel | 22 |

**Key insight:** Simple golf visuals = 190 views. Text-heavy memes = 22-44 views. Pure visual wins.

### What's Working
- ✅ "Mulligan Advice" is a good signature format (consistent branding)
- ✅ Visual style is consistent (green/white, golf course backgrounds)
- ✅ The golf ball close-up reel crushed it (190 views)

### What to Adjust
- ⚠️ Bio needs personality — too feature-focused right now
- ⚠️ Less text-heavy memes, more pure golf visuals
- ⚠️ The 190-view post proves: beautiful golf content > meme text overlays
- ⚠️ Try "Mulligan Advice" as video/reel instead of static image

### Visual Style
- **Colors:** Green + white (golf course vibes)
- **Content:** Clean text on golf backgrounds, high-quality golf visuals
- **Logo:** Golf ball head silhouette — clean and recognizable

### Content Voice
- Sarcastic "advice" that's really just coping
- Self-deprecating weekend golfer energy
- Blaming everything except yourself

### Strategy for Week 1
The 190-view post shows the path. Beautiful golf content gets reach.

| Priority | Content Type |
|----------|--------------|
| 1st | Pure golf visuals (like the 190-view post) |
| 2nd | Mulligan Advice (try as reels, not static) |
| 3rd | Meme content (less text) |

___________________________________________________________

## DEV (@dotsystemsdevs)

**Current:** 681 followers, 8 posts

**Target:** Indie hackers, builders, makers

**Vibe:** Build in public, real numbers, maker/dev hybrid

### Bio

**Name field:** `Dot · Indie App Dev`

**Bio:**
```
shipping apps, sharing numbers
maker stuff + build in public
free playbook 👇
```

**Category:** App / Personal Blog

| Part | ✅ |
|------|---|
| Clear Bio | "shipping apps, sharing numbers" |
| Category | App or Personal Blog (set in settings) |
| Call-to-Action | "free playbook 👇" + link to vibecoders toolkit |

✅ Acknowledges both audiences (makers + app dev) and leads somewhere.

### Performance Data
| Post | Type | Views |
|------|------|-------|
| 3D printed part closeup | Reel | **311** |
| "Small desk upgrades - 3d print" | Reel | **254** |
| "3D print · Code · Build" | Reel | **204** |
| "Get all my 3D-designs free" | Reel | 158 |
| App interface dark | Reel | 156 |
| "Not Everyone Should Code" meme | Reel | 67 |

**Key insight:** 3D printing/maker content = 200-311 views. App dev content = 67-156 views. Audience loves physical maker stuff.

### Identity Split
⚠️ This account has two audiences:
1. **Makers** (3D print, desk setups) — high engagement
2. **Indie hackers** (apps, build in public) — lower engagement

**Strategy:** Use maker content for reach, then funnel to app content. Don't abandon what works.

### What's Working
- ✅ 681 followers — real audience base
- ✅ Maker content gets solid reach (200-300 views)
- ✅ Dark mode aesthetic is consistent
- ✅ Highlights organized by app (Mulligan, Slothy, Lotty)

### What to Adjust
- ⚠️ Bio needs more personality and CTA
- ⚠️ Don't abandon maker content — it brings reach
- ⚠️ Mix: 60% maker/behind-the-scenes, 40% app/numbers
- ⚠️ Use maker posts to drive traffic, app posts to convert

### Visual Style
- **Colors:** Dark mode, accent colors
- **Content:** Clean aesthetic, 3D prints, desk setups, app screenshots

### Content Voice
- Direct, honest
- Real numbers and learnings
- Maker + dev hybrid — "I build things, physical and digital"

### Strategy for Week 1
Use what already works. Maker content = reach. App content = purpose.

| Priority | Content Type |
|----------|--------------|
| 1st | Maker/behind-the-scenes (what gets views) |
| 2nd | Build in public numbers (what you want to grow) |
| 3rd | App screenshots (sparingly) |

## Algorithm Secrets

### Most Important: "Sends per Reach"
Instagram now prioritizes how often people **DM your post to a friend**. More important than likes.

**How to get sends:**
- Relatable content ("omg this is so me")
- Funny/sarcastic takes people want to share
- Hot takes that make people tag friends

### First Hour is Critical
Engagement in the first 60 minutes determines if your post spreads.

**Action:** After posting, spend 15-20 min engaging on other posts in your niche. This drives traffic back to your fresh post.

---

## Content Bank Strategy

### Preload Your Content Bank

Don't create content day-by-day. Build a bank first.

| Step | Action |
|------|--------|
| 1 | Create a content bank folder |
| 2 | Prepare first 9 videos/posts before you start posting |
| 3 | Always stay 3-5 posts ahead |

### Batch Work

Work in batches = more efficient, consistent quality.

| Type | What |
|------|------|
| **Batch Filming** | Film 5-10 videos in one session |
| **Batch Editing** | Edit all videos in one session |

**Why:** Same setup, same energy, same lighting. Faster than doing one at a time.

### Hook Layering (First 3 Seconds)

Layer **multiple hooks** in the first 3 seconds. Don't rely on just one.

| Hook Type | What It Is | Example |
|-----------|------------|---------|
| **Text Hook** | Text on screen | "Nobody talks about this..." |
| **Audible Hook** | Voice/sound | Start mid-sentence, surprising sound |
| **Visual Hook** | Eye-catching visual | Movement, bright colors, face close-up |

**Best practice:** Use ALL THREE in the first 3 seconds.

Example:
- Visual: Close-up of golf ball in water
- Text: "This is why I quit keeping score"
- Audio: Splash sound + sigh

### Reel SEO (Keywords)

Keywords help Instagram understand what your reel is about → ranks in Instagram Search.

**Where to put keywords:**

| Place | Priority | Example |
|-------|----------|---------|
| **Caption** | HIGH | "Golf tips for beginners who lose balls" |
| **Text on screen** | HIGH | Pop-up text with keyword phrases |
| **Cover photo text** | MEDIUM | Explains what reel is about |
| **Hashtags** | LOW | Still use, but less important now |

### Cover Photos

Be **intentional** with cover photos — don't just pick a random frame.

| Rule | Why |
|------|-----|
| Text must be easy to read | People scroll fast, hard-to-read = skip |
| Explain what the reel is about | Curiosity → click |
| Keep it simple | 3-5 words max |
| High contrast | Dark text on light, or light text on dark |

**Bad:** Blurry frame with tiny text
**Good:** Clean image + bold text: "Why I lost 12 balls"

**Workflow:**
1. Upload reel as **draft** first
2. Write caption with keywords
3. Add text overlays with keyword phrases
4. Create cover photo that explains the reel
5. Use same phrases as your inspiration reel (if recreating)

**Tip:** Hashtags are less important now. Keywords in caption + text matter more.

---

### Reel Research (How to Find What Works)

**Only study REELS** — not static posts. Reels reach new audiences through Explore.

| Rule | Why |
|------|-----|
| Save viral reels in your niche | Learn what works |
| Only save RECENT (< 3 months old) | Recent = proof it still works |
| Analyze format → recreate | Don't copy, adapt to your style |

**Research process:**
1. Search hashtags in your niche
2. Filter by Reels only
3. Save ones with high engagement
4. Note: hook, format, length, style
5. Recreate with your own twist

### Test 9 Different Styles

Week 1 = testing. Try different content types to see what YOUR audience responds to.

| Style | Example |
|-------|---------|
| **Education** | "How to track your golf score properly" |
| **Info** | "Did you know 90% of golfers lose 3+ balls per round?" |
| **Entertainment** | Funny fail compilation |
| **Relatable** | "POV: You say 'that's actually not bad' after every terrible shot" |

**Per account, test:**
- 2-3 education/info posts
- 2-3 entertainment posts
- 2-3 relatable posts

### After First 9 Posts: Analyze

After posting 9 reels, **stop and analyze** before making more.

**Metrics to compare:**

| Metric | What It Tells You |
|--------|-------------------|
| **Watch time** | Most important — did people actually watch? |
| **Shares/Sends** | Did people want to share it? |
| **Saves** | Did people find it valuable? |
| **Likes** | Basic engagement |

**Analysis questions:**
1. Which video got the **best watch time**?
2. Which got the **most shares**?
3. What do the top performers have in common?

**Action:**
- **Winners:** Recreate that style/format
- **Losers:** Why didn't they work? Hook weak? Too long? Wrong topic?

**Draw conclusions:**

| If this flopped... | Maybe because... |
|--------------------|------------------|
| Education post | Too boring, no hook |
| Entertainment | Not relatable to your audience |
| Relatable | Not specific enough to niche |

**Then:** Double down on what works. Stop doing what doesn't.

### Weekly Reflection

Ask yourself every week:

- [ ] **What could I do?** (new ideas, experiments)
- [ ] **What's working?** (keep doing this)
- [ ] **What are the numbers saying?** (data > feelings)

> Keep learning. Keep trying new things. The algorithm changes — you should too.

## Daily Routine (1 hour)

| Time | Task |
|------|------|
| **15 min** | Create today's content |
| **5 min** | Post + hashtags |
| **20 min** | 5-3-1 engagement (see below) |
| **10 min** | Reply to any comments on your posts |
| **10 min** | Browse hashtags, engage more |

---

## 5-3-1 Rule (Do This Daily)

For each account, every day:

| Action | Amount | What to do |
|--------|--------|------------|
| **Like** | 5 posts | From your target hashtags |
| **Comment** | 3 posts | Meaningful/funny comments |
| **Follow** | 1 person | Your ideal follower |

**Total per day:** 15 likes, 9 comments, 3 follows across all accounts.

---

## Comment Strategy

### Your Style: Funny / Sarcastic

**DON'T write:**
- "Nice!"
- "Great post!"
- "🔥🔥🔥"
- "Love this!"

These are invisible to the algorithm and don't build connection.

### Comment Templates (Mulligan - Golf)

**On golf fail videos:**
> "This is why I keep a spare club in the car. And a spare car."

**On 'great shot' posts:**
> "Meanwhile my ball is still looking for its dad in the woods"

**On golf tips:**
> "Instructions unclear, ball went the other way"

**On course photos:**
> "Beautiful. I'd find a way to lose a ball here too"

### Comment Templates (Slothy - Productivity)

**On productivity tips:**
> "Saved this. Will never look at it again. As is tradition."

**On todo list posts:**
> "Bold of you to assume I remember where I put my list"

**On 'finally did the thing' posts:**
> "One task down. Time for a 3 hour reward break."

**On productivity memes:**
> "I feel personally attacked and I'm here for it"

### Comment Templates (Dev - Indie Hackers)

**On shipped products:**
> "Shipped > perfect. This is the way."

**On struggle posts:**
> "The grind is real. At least the bugs keep us company"

**On 'how I got X users':**
> "Taking notes. Probably won't follow them. But taking notes."

---

## Hashtag Strategy

**Rule:** Mix big hashtags (reach) + micro hashtags (under 50k posts = actually discoverable).

### Mulligan (use 8-10 per post)

**Big (reach):**
```
#golf #golfmemes #golflife #golfhumor
```

**Medium (targeted):**
```
#weekendgolfer #amateurgolf #golfproblems #golfaddict
```

**Micro (discoverable):**
```
#casualgolfer #golffails #golfstruggles #weekendgolf
#mulliganneeded #bogeylife #hackersgolf
```

### Slothy (use 8-10 per post)

**Big (reach):**
```
#productivity #todolist #motivation
```

**Medium (targeted):**
```
#productivitytips #getthingsdone #organizing #workfromhome
```

**Micro (discoverable):**
```
#productivitystruggles #procrastinationstation #todolistapp
#sundayreset #mondaymotivation #listmaker
```

**For reach (but never mention in content):**
```
#adhd #adhdmemes #adhdlife
```

> Note: Use ADHD hashtags for reach, but never mention ADHD in your posts.

### Dev (use 8-10 per post)

**Big (reach):**
```
#startup #entrepreneur #coding
```

**Medium (targeted):**
```
#buildinpublic #indiehacker #solodev #appdev
```

**Micro (discoverable):**
```
#shipit #makersmovement #indiedev #solofounder
#shipfast #buildinginpublic #devlife
```

### Hashtag Rotation

Don't use the exact same hashtags every post — Instagram may reduce reach. Rotate between sets.
