## Algorithm Secrets

### Most Important: "Sends per Reach"
Instagram now prioritizes how often people **DM your post to a friend**. More important than likes.

**How to get sends:**
- Relatable content ("omg this is so me")
- Funny/sarcastic takes people want to share
- Hot takes that make people tag friends

### First Hour is Critical
Engagement in the first 60 minutes determines if your post spreads.

**Action:** After posting, spend 15-20 min engaging on other posts in your niche. This drives traffic back to your fresh post.

---

## Daily Routine (1 hour)

| Time | Task |
|------|------|
| **15 min** | Create today's content |
| **5 min** | Post + hashtags |
| **20 min** | 5-3-1 engagement (see below) |
| **10 min** | Reply to any comments on your posts |
| **10 min** | Browse hashtags, engage more |

---

## 5-3-1 Rule (Do This Daily)

For each account, every day:

| Action | Amount | What to do |
|--------|--------|------------|
| **Like** | 5 posts | From your target hashtags |
| **Comment** | 3 posts | Meaningful/funny comments |
| **Follow** | 1 person | Your ideal follower |

**Total per day:** 15 likes, 9 comments, 3 follows across all accounts.

---

## Comment Strategy

### Your Style: Funny / Sarcastic

**DON'T write:**
- "Nice!"
- "Great post!"
- "🔥🔥🔥"
- "Love this!"

These are invisible to the algorithm and don't build connection.

### Comment Templates (Mulligan - Golf)

**On golf fail videos:**
> "This is why I keep a spare club in the car. And a spare car."

**On 'great shot' posts:**
> "Meanwhile my ball is still looking for its dad in the woods"

**On golf tips:**
> "Instructions unclear, hit the cart girl"

**On course photos:**
> "Beautiful. I'd find a way to lose a ball here too"

### Comment Templates (Slothy - Productivity)

**On productivity tips:**
> "Saved this. Will never look at it again. As is tradition."

**On todo list posts:**
> "Bold of you to assume I remember where I put my list"

**On 'finally did the thing' posts:**
> "One task down. Time for a 3 hour reward break."

**On productivity memes:**
> "I feel personally attacked and I'm here for it"

### Comment Templates (Dev - Indie Hackers)

**On shipped products:**
> "Shipped > perfect. This is the way."

**On struggle posts:**
> "The grind is real. At least the bugs keep us company"

**On 'how I got X users':**
> "Taking notes. Probably won't follow them. But taking notes."

|------|---------|-----------|-------|-------|----------|-------|--------|---------------|

**Check daily:** Instagram Insights on each post

**Most important metrics:**
1. **Shares/Sends** — Algorithm loves this
2. **Saves** — Shows value
3. **Comments** — Engagement signal
4. **Reach** — How far it spread

1. Which account got the most engagement?
2. Which content type performed best? (meme vs advice vs reel vs story)
3. Did any post get shared/saved more than others?
4. Which comments got replies? (your engagement working?)
5. Any follower growth?
