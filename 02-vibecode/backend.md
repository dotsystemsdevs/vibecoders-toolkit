# CNN & Backend

Learnings from building ML models and backend services.

## Plan mode strategy

| Step | Action |
|------|--------|
| 1 | Write high-level plan with steps all the way to production |
| 2 | When starting a step → ask AI to write detailed sub-steps |
| 3 | Give AI sub-steps one at a time |
| 4 | Ask what you can do in parallel |

| Mistake | Better approach |
|---------|-----------------|
| "Do what you think is best" | Be specific, steer the plan yourself |
| Letting AI decide architecture | The more you know, the better you prompt |

**Action:** Never say "do what you think is best". Always be specific.

---

## Backend & security

| Observation | Action |
|-------------|--------|
| "Vibecoding" with backend creates vulnerabilities | Always analyze security when building with backend |
| Need version control discipline | Use GitHub branches + CI/CD |
| Need local testing | Build HTML page for diagnostics |

**Action:** If you have a backend, do a security review before shipping.

## Common mistakes

| Mistake | What happened | Action |
|---------|---------------|--------|
| "Do what you think is best" to AI | Bad results | Be specific, steer the plan yourself |
