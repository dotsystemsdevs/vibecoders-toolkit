# UI & UX

## Background

UI perfectionism is the #1 time killer for indie devs. You don't need a design system. You need screens that work.

---

## Do this

### Build screen by screen

| Step | Action |
|------|--------|
| 1 | Describe app + key features to AI, ask how screens should look |
| 2 | Build home screen first, refine until satisfied |
| 3 | Continue screen by screen — don't move on until it works |
| 4 | At the end: review all screens, minor tweaks |
| 5 | Last = settings, then standardize (cards, buttons, colors) |

**Why standardize last?** Doing it early limits your creativity. Get the screens right first.

### Content & copy

| Rule | Why |
|------|-----|
| Write copy yourself first | GPT-copy feels fake, people notice |
| Use AI only for translation/polish | Keeps it authentic |
| Take screenshots during the day | Content for Instagram later |

## Tools that did NOT work

| Tool | Problem | What to do instead |
|------|---------|-------------------|
| bolt.new | Bad UI, wasted credits | Build screen by screen in Claude |
| rapidexpo | Same problem | Skip it |
| "Build all components at once" | Ugly, errors, hard to change | One screen at a time |
| Posting in UX/UI groups | Got banned + bullied | Use the right forum for the right purpose |
| Discord/Telegram for recruiting | Almost no response | Focus on Reddit |

## Evidence

### Productivity patterns we found

| Observation | What we do now |
|-------------|---------------|
| Most effective in the morning | Hard work before lunch |
| Dip after workout | Workout after other work |
| UI perfectionism kills momentum | Set time limit, ship "good enough" |
| Reddit addiction | Scheduled Reddit time, not 24/7 |
| Risk of burnout | Planned rest days |

*Ship first. Polish later.*
