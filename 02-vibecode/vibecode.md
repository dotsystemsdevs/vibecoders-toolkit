# 02 Vibecode

AI-assisted development where you describe what you want and AI generates code.

## Loop

```
Describe → Generate → Review → Test → Repeat
```

| Step | What |
|------|------|
| Describe | Be specific |
| Generate | AI creates code |
| Review | Don't blindly accept |
| Test | Test immediately |
| Repeat | Commit often |

---

## When it works

| Use case | Why |
|----------|-----|
| Demos/prototypes | Fast, throwaway OK |
| Landing pages | Simple, low risk |
| Internal tools | Less security pressure |

---

## When it doesn't work

| Use case | Why |
|----------|-----|
| Production with user data | Security vulnerabilities |
| Complex backends | Inconsistent as codebase grows |
| Payments | Too risky |
| 100+ users | Architecture breaks |

---

## Tools

| Tool | What |
|------|------|
| **Cursor** | AI-enhanced VS Code, best for coding |
| **Claude Code** | Terminal-based, powerful |
| **Windsurf** | Standalone AI editor |
| **Bolt.new** | Full app generation |

---

## Models

| Model | Best for |
|-------|----------|
| Claude Sonnet | Coding, debugging |
| Claude Opus | Complex architecture |
| GPT-5 | Brainstorming, marketing |
| v0.dev | UI prototypes |

## Rules

- [ ] Plan first — implementation plan before coding
- [ ] Be specific — vague prompts = bad code
- [ ] Review everything — don't blindly accept
- [ ] Test constantly — don't batch
- [ ] Know when to stop — get dev help before users pay
