# UI & UX

How to build UI without getting stuck in perfectionism.

---

## UI building method

| Step | Action |
|------|--------|
| 1 | Tell ChatGPT: app, backend, key features → ask how screens should look (content + copy) |
| 2 | Build home screen → refine until satisfied |
| 3 | Continue screen by screen, don't move on until satisfied |
| 4 | At the end: review all screens, minor improvements |
| 5 | Last = settings, then standardize (cards, buttons etc.) |

**Why standardize last?** Doing it early limits your creativity.

**Action:** Build one screen at a time. Standardize at the end.

## Tools that did NOT work

| Tool | Problem | Action |
|------|---------|--------|
| bolt.new | Not satisfied with UI, wastes credits | Skip it |
| rapidexpo | Same problem | Skip it |
| Plan mode "build all components" | Ugly, hard to change, errors | Build screen by screen instead |

## Content & Instagram

| Observation | Action |
|-------------|--------|
| Low response initially (0 likes) | Don't expect immediate results |
| GPT-copy feels bad | Write yourself first, use AI only for translation |
| Need content | Take more screenshots during the day |
| People notice fake | Keep it authentic |

**Action:** Write copy yourself. Use AI for translation only.

## Productivity

| Observation | Action |
|-------------|--------|
| Most effective in the morning | Do hard work in the morning |
| Dip after workout | Move workout to after other work |
| Hard to follow schedule with many tabs | Reduce distractions |
| UI perfectionism | Set time limit, ship "good enough" |
| Reddit addiction | Schedule Reddit time (not 24/7) |
| Risk of burnout | Plan rest days |

**Action:** Know your energy patterns. Schedule around them.

## Common mistakes

| Mistake | What happened | Action |
|---------|---------------|--------|
| UI perfectionism | Got stuck, frustrated | Ship first, polish later |
| GPT for all copy | Felt bad, took time | Write yourself, AI for polish |
| Reddit 24/7 | Hard to stop | Schedule specific time |
| bolt.new / rapidexpo | Wasted credits | Build screen by screen in Claude |
| Post in UX/UI groups | Ban + bullied | Use the right forum for the right purpose |
| Discord/Telegram for recruiting | Almost no response | Focus on Reddit |
