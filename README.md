# Vibecoders Toolkit

I shipped 3 apps to Google Play with $0 budget. This is the full playbook.

---

## Start Here

1. Read [what-is-mvp](01-mvp/what-is-mvp.md) — 2 min
2. Build ONE feature that works
3. Get 20 testers via the [testing guide](03-testing/android.md)

## The Flow

```
MVP → Vibecode → Testing → Launch → Marketing → Tracking
```

| Phase | What | Key file |
|-------|------|----------|
| [01-mvp](01-mvp/) | Build the smallest product | [what-is-mvp](01-mvp/what-is-mvp.md) |
| [02-vibecode](02-vibecode/) | AI coding + prompts | [vibecode](02-vibecode/vibecode.md) |
| [03-testing](03-testing/) | Closed testing + feedback | [android](03-testing/android.md) |
| [04-launch](04-launch/) | Store listing + ASO | [launch](04-launch/launch.md) |
| [05-marketing](05-marketing/) | Instagram + DMs | [instagram](05-marketing/instagram.md) |
| [06-tracking](06-tracking/) | Real numbers, all apps | [comparison](06-tracking/comparison.md) |
