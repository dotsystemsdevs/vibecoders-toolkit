# Vibecoders Toolkit

A step-by-step guide to shipping apps — from MVP to closed testing to your first users.

Built from real experience. Nothing made up.

## The Journey

```
MVP → Screenshots → Closed Testing → Recruit Testers → Feedback → Marketing
```

---

## Step 1: MVP

Build the app. It doesn't need to be perfect.

- [ ] App works (core features)
- [ ] Build UI one screen at a time
- [ ] Standardize (buttons, cards) last

**Rule:** Ship when it works. Don't wait for perfection.

---

## Step 2: Screenshots

When building in Expo, create Play Store images.

- [ ] Screenshots of all key screens
- [ ] Figma for Play Store graphics
- [ ] Save to `docs/screenshots/`

---

## Step 3: Closed Testing

Upload to Play Console.

- [ ] AAB built and uploaded
- [ ] Closed testing group created
- [ ] Play Store images uploaded

| Goal | Target |
|------|--------|
| Members | 30+ for feedback, 100+ for approval |
| Timeline | ~2 weeks |

## Step 4: Recruit Testers

Post everywhere. You'll get banned sometimes — keep going until you find groups that work.

### Do This

| Channel | Result |
|---------|--------|
| r/AndroidClosedTesting | Best — post here first |
| Niche forums (golf, poker, etc.) | Best feedback + validates demand |
| Reddit test-for-test | Works — reply fast |

### Skip This

| Channel | Result |
|---------|--------|
| Discord / Telegram | No response |
| Reddit UX/UI groups | You'll get banned |

### Strategy

1. Post in r/AndroidClosedTesting
2. Turn on notifications
3. Reply fast to "test for test"
4. Be active when USA is awake
5. ~15 messages per day
6. Slow down after day 3-4 (still works)

### Real Numbers (Lotty app)

| Day | Members |
|-----|---------|
| 1 | 25 |
| 3 | 57 |
| 7 | 96 |
| 12 | 110 (approved) |

## Step 5: Feedback & Patch

Collect feedback and fix in batches.

### Collect Feedback

1. Screenshot all feedback immediately
2. Save to `docs/screenshots/`
3. Log in BACKLOG.md with screenshot link

### Patch Cycle

```
ship → feedback → backlog → prioritize → patch → ship
```

| Rule | Why |
|------|-----|
| Wait ~1 week | Distance = better decisions |
| Pick 3-5 items | Don't fix everything at once |
| P1 = must, P2 = should, P3 = later | Focus on what matters |

| Template | Use |

| [BACKLOG.md](templates/BACKLOG.md) | Bugs, features, feedback |
| [CHANGELOG.md](templates/CHANGELOG.md) | Shipped changes |

## What Worked

| Factor | Lesson |
|--------|--------|
| UI one screen at a time | Build, be satisfied, move on |
| Screenshots in Expo | Do it while building |
| Post everywhere | Get banned sometimes, find the right groups |
| Niche forums | Best feedback + validates demand |

## What Didn't Work

| Thing | Problem |
|-------|---------|

| Discord / Telegram | No response |
| Reddit UX/UI groups | Banned + negative response |
| "Do what you think is best" to AI | Bad results — be specific |
