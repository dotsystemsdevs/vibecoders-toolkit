## Quick reference

### The loop

```
ship → collect feedback → backlog → prioritize → patch → ship
```

### Key actions

| Area | Action |
|------|--------|
| Shipping | Don't wait for perfection. Ship when it works. |
| Testers | Post in r/AndroidClosedTesting + niche forums |
| Feedback | Screenshot everything. No backlog item without evidence. |
| Patches | Wait ~1 week. Pick 3-5 items. |
| AI | Never say "do what you think is best". Be specific. |
| UI | Build screen by screen. Standardize at the end. |
