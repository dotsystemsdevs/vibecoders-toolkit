# Learnings

## 1. Bio

### Structure
```
Line 1: [Category] | [What you do]    ← Instagram categorizes you
Line 2: [Value prop / hook]           ← Why follow?
Line 3: [Social proof or benefit]     ← Trust
Line 4: [CTA] 👇                       ← Action
```

### Tools

| Tool | What | Example |
|------|------|---------|
| Bitly | Shorten links | bit.ly/slothy |
| Linktree | Multiple links | linktr.ee/app |

---

## 2. Reels

### Formula
```
Hook (0-1 sec) + Relatable content + "Send to someone who..." + "Follow for more"
```

### Rules
- 3-6 sec videos
- Every reel needs "Follow for more" CTA
- Share-CTA = reach, Humor = engagement

---

## 3. Carousels

### Formula
```
Strong cover + "Swipe →" on every slide + CTA on last slide
```

---

## Mistakes to Avoid

- Posting carousel without swipe CTA
- Posting reel without follow CTA
- Expecting follows without asking
- Long videos (keep under 6 sec)
