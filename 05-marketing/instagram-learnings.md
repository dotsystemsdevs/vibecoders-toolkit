# Instagram Learnings

## Background

Instagram is free marketing. But it only works if you understand the algorithm: engagement drives reach, and CTAs drive engagement.

## Do this

### Bio structure

```
Line 1: [Category] | [What you do]    <- Instagram categorizes you
Line 2: [Value prop / hook]            <- Why follow?
Line 3: [Social proof or benefit]      <- Trust
Line 4: [CTA]                          <- Action
```

### Reels formula

```
Hook (0-1 sec) + Relatable content + "Send to someone who..." + "Follow for more"
```

Rules:
- 3-6 sec videos
- Every reel needs "Follow for more" CTA
- Share-CTA = reach, Humor = engagement

### Carousels formula

```
Strong cover + "Swipe ->" on every slide + CTA on last slide
```

## Mistakes we made

| Mistake | What happened | What to do instead |
|---------|---------------|-------------------|
| Carousel without swipe CTA | Nobody swiped | Always add "Swipe ->" |
| Reel without follow CTA | 0 profile visits | Always add "Follow for more" |
| Expecting follows without asking | 0 follows despite views | Ask. Every. Time. |
| Long videos | People skip | Keep under 6 sec |
