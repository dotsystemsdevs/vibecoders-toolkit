I built Mulligan — tracks your golf rounds, lost balls, and lets you share highlight cards.

It's free on Google Play, link in bio if you wanna check it out.

Hey thanks for following! 🙌

I build indie apps — Slothy (todo for procrastinators) and Mulligan (golf tracker). Both free, both on Google Play.
