## Patterns

| Type | Reach | Quality |
|------|-------|---------|
| Share-CTA | High (80%+ non-followers) | Medium |
| Humor/Tips | Low reach | Perfect (0% skip, 5-7x loop) |

**Best combo:** "Send to someone who..." + "Follow for more"

**Biggest miss:** 0 profile visits, 0 follows — because we forgot the "Follow for more" CTA.
